# Connector UI

The connector URL is a URL you can simply host on your website or send by email. No specific integration is required to let your clients to link their card. This connector UI is used if your use case is just aggregation. If you want to use aggregation with payments, this is a different flow and you need to use the Url from the portal under Integration Codes >> Add Payment Profile.

An example url looks like this: 

- PRODUCTION `https://connector.aggregation.zumrails.com/?customerid=<YOUR-CUSOMTER-ID>`.
- SANDBOX `https://connector-sandbox.aggregation.zumrails.com/?customerid=<YOUR-CUSOMTER-ID>`.

:::info
We recommend you using the **[Configure](./configure)** page to build your URL.

## Access the data

After a new connection is made, if you are using the Connector UI, the data can be available to you in different ways, listed below:

### Access the data in Zūm Rails portal

For every new connection made for a specific card, a new user will automatically be created in the Zūm Rails portal, you can search it under the User page by the user name or email. In this option, zero integration is required, but it's a bit difficult to match the user, since the name on the bank account might be different than the name you have in your file. 

### Access the data via javascript event listener

Every interaction with the UI triggers a javascript event listener that your host page can listen to. Each message has a step as described below.


<Tabs
  defaultValue="tab1"
  values={[
    {label: 'Add the event listener on your website', value: 'tab1'},
    {label: 'Example message', value: 'tab2'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="tab1">

  ```html
      <script>
        window.addEventListener('message', function(e) {
          console.log(e.data);
        });
      </script>
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="tab2">

  ```javascript
  {
      step: 'INSTITUTIONSELECTED'
      data: {
          intitution: 'asdf...asdf'
      }
  }
  ```
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Steps that can be listened:

Step | Description 
----- | ----
CONNECTORLOADED | When the Connector is loaded
CONNECTORCLOSED | When the Connector is closed
CONSENTACCEPTED | When the consent was accepted
INSTITUTIONSELECTED | When an institution is selected
AUTHENTICATEINITIATED | When we start authenticating the connection
SECURITYQUESTIONPROMPTED | When a security question is prompted
SECURITYQUESTIONANSWERINITIATED | When the security question is answered and we resume the authentication
AUTHENTICATECOMPLETED | When authentication is completed
GETINFORMATIONINITIATED | When the get card information process starts
GETINFORMATIONCOMPLETED | When the get card information process completes
CONNECTIONSUCCESSFULLYCOMPLETED | **When the process is completed.** The property `data` will contain up to 4 fields that can be used to link the user from your system with the aggregation. Example: `{ requestid: 'asdf...asdf', cardid: 'asdf...asdf', extrafield1: '', extrafield2: '' }`
GENERICERROR | When an unexpected error occurs

### Access the data via webhooks

You can receive the information as well by webhook, to do that you have to open Zūm Rails portal, navigate to settings > webhook & api settings, then enable the aggregation events.

Once a new connection is made, a webhook will be fired to the specified url. More information on how to secure webhook, can be found [here](../api-specification/webhooks):
