Nothing blocks you from testing with a live card, but we recommend using the Zūm Rails Test Institution.

- If you are using the Connector without a javascript library, you have to specify the parameter `testinstitution=true` in the url.
- If you are using the javascript library, you have to pass the property `testinstitution:true` in the config parameter.

By doing the configuration above, the first institution in the list will be Zūm Rails Test Institution.
