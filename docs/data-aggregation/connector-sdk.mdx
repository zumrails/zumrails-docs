# Connector SDK

The javascript sdk library allows you to build a more robust integration with the Zūm Rails Connector. Instead of hosting a public URL, the library offers the possibility for you to first create a temporary token, then initiate and configure the Connector via Javascript and finally receive callbacks when the connection is completed.

> Steps to follow in order to complete your integration:

1. Call Zūm Rails API to create a Connector Token
2. Refer the javascript sdk library into your website, build your configuration options and init the sdk
3. Handle the callbacks
4. Go Live

## Create a token

To create a token you have first to authenticate in Zūm Rails API. More information can be found [here](../api-specification/authentication)

After, the second step is to create a token for the Connector SDK. 

`Method: POST`

`Endpoint: {{env}}/api/aggregationconnector/createtoken`

<Tabs
  defaultValue="tab1"
  values={[
    {label: 'Payload (empty)', value: 'tab1'},
    {label: 'Response', value: 'tab2'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="tab1">

  ```json
      {}
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="tab2">

  ```json
  {
    "statusCode": 200,
    "message": "POST Request successful.",
    "isError": false,
    "result": {
        "Token": "production-75c90e75e76c49f5a3ae4504afc8cfc5",
        "ExpirationUTC": "2022-02-17T22:33:44.9490972Z",
        "CustomerId": "a3510efb-5edb-4972-96be-a5a91ddfa56a",
        "CompanyName": "Demo Aggregation"
    }
}
  ```
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You will need to use the property `result.Token`.

:::info
Each token is valid only once, for 15 minutes. 
:::

## Install JS SDK 

Refer the js library below into your website.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="tab1"
  values={[
    {label: 'Insert on your website', value: 'tab1'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="tab1">

  ```html
    <script id="zumrailsconnector" src="https://cdn.aggregation.zumrails.com/connector.js" type="text/javascript" async=""></script>
  ```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>


## Init the JS SDK

**The library expects 2 mandatory parameters:**

Parameter | Description 
----- | ----
token | The token received in the endpoint `{{env}}/api/aggregationconnector/createtoken`
config | A json config representing all the configurations available and described [here](#configuration)

Below you can find an example of the code needed to init the JS SDK.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="tab1"
  values={[
    {label: 'JS SDK Code', value: 'tab1'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="tab1">

  ```html
    <script>
        $(function() {
            $('#btnGoConnect').click(function() {
                const token = '<THE TOKEN RECEIVED IN THE CREATE TOKEN ENDPOINT>';

                ZumRailsConnector.init({
                    token: token,
                    options: {
                        accountselector: true,
                        testinstitution: true,
                        backbutton: true,
                        closebutton: true,
                        extrafield1: '<my-extra-data>
                    },
                    onLoad: function () {
                        console.log('onLoad');
                    },
                    onError: function (error) {
                        console.log('onError', error);
                    },
                    onSuccess: function (requestid, cardid, extrafield1, extrafield2) {
                        console.log('onSuccess', requestid, cardid, extrafield1, extrafield2);
                    },
                    onStepChanged: function (data) {
                        console.log('onStepChanged', data);
                    },
                    onConnectorClosed: function () {
                        console.log('onConnectorClosed');
                    }
                });
            });
        });
    </script>
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::info
We recommend you using the **[Configure](./configure)** page to build the `options` property.

## Callbacks

When something happens, the sdk library will fire a few callbacks, this allows you to easily get the data and take an immediate action. For example, call the endpoint to get the full card information onSuccess by passing the requestId or cardId

### onLoad

This callback is triggered when the UI is loaded and presented on the screen.

_Parameters_

- There are no parameters in this callback


### onConnectorClosed

This callback is triggered when the end user clicks in the X button to close the Connector

_Parameters_

- There are no parameters in this callback

### onError

This callback is triggered when the connection failed by any error not expected in the happy flow

_Parameters_

- error: An error message explaining the reason why the failure happened

### onSuccess

This callback is triggered when the connection is completed and the card was successfully linked

_Parameters_

- requestid: The id of the request, unique per attempt
- cardid: The id of the card, unique per card and institution number. If you connect the same card 2 times, the cardid will keep being the same
- extrafield1: The extra field you can pass as an option, at this moment this field is returned as well
- extrafield2: The extra field you can pass as an option, at this moment this field is returned as well

### onStepChanged

This callback is triggered when there is a page change or an action was taken by end the user

**Parameters** 

- data: A json object with this format `{ step: <STEP>, data: {EXTRA DATA}}`

A list of steps can be found here:

Parameter | Description 
----- | ----
CONNECTORLOADED | When the Connector is loaded
CONNECTORCLOSED | When the Connector is closed
CONSENTACCEPTED | When the consent was accepted
INSTITUTIONSELECTED | When an institution is selected
