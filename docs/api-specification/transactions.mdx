## Overview

At Zūm Rails, there are 5 ways to create transactions, when using the portal or via API. When creating a transaction via API, the transaction type “ZumRailsType” must be specified.

There are five transaction types (ZumRailsType):

- FundZumWallet
- WithdrawZumWallet
- AccountsPayable
- AccountsReceivable
- UserTransfer

:::note
- Zūm Rails allows money to be sent to a user from your virtual wallet or from your funding source.
- Zūm Rails allows money to be collected from a user to your virtual wallet or to your funding source.
:::

1. If you want to send money from your **Funding Source** to **Zūm Wallet**, use ZumRailsType **FundZumWallet** and inform:
    - FundingSourceId
    - WalletId
2. If you want to withdraw money from **Zūm Wallet** to your **Funding Source**, use ZumRailsType **WithdrawZumWallet** and inform:
    - FundingSourceId
    - WalletId
3. If you want to send money (accounts payable) from your **Zūm Wallet** to a **User**, use ZumRailsType **AccountsPayable** and inform:
    - UserId
    - WalletId
4. If you want to send money (accounts payable) from your **Funding Source** to a **User**, use ZumRailsType **AccountsPayable** and inform:
    - UserId
    - FundingSourceId
5. If you want to withdraw money (accounts receivable) from a **User** to your **Zūm Wallet**, use ZumRailsType **AccountsReceivable** and inform:
    - UserId
    - WalletId
6. If you want to withdraw money (accounts receivable) from a **User** to your **Funding Source**, use ZumRailsType **AccountsReceivable** and inform:
    - UserId
    - FundingSourceId
7. If you want to move money between your **Users**, use ZumRailsType **UserTransfer** and inform:
    - UserId
    - TargetUserId


:::info
- For accounts payable use-case, Zūm Rails recommend you to first Fund the Zūm Wallet, so that the money can be quickly moved.
:::

:::info
- For accounts receivable use-case Zūm Rails, recommend you to move funds from the User to the Zūm Wallet, then set up an automatic daily withdrawal at the end of each day to your funding source.
:::

:::info
- Credit Card transactions are settled directly into the merchant account. Hence, it is not required to specify the `WalletId` or `FundingSourceId` while creating a credit card transaction

:::danger
In a sandbox environment, real bank operations are not performed. It provides a way to simulate success, failures and review situations.
:::

:::caution
To simulate a failure, use one of the keywords to simulate failure (shown below) in the field COMMENT while creating a transaction. If no keyword is informed, or something else is informed, the transaction will eventually change status to "Completed".
This service is executed every minute.
:::

:::caution
Interac transactions in sandbox will be simulated like the real flow. Hence, emails will be sent out to the user email mentioned when the transaction is created. Make sure to use a real email address to be able to simulate this flow and complete the transaction.
:::

:::caution
Occasionally, Interac flags transactions believed to be possible fraud cases. When Zum Rails is notified, the status of the transaction is changed to "Under Review".To simulate this situation (only available for interac for now), create a transaction with the keyword "UnderReview" in the COMMENT field. Transactions can be flagged "Under Review" for two other scenarios:
Scenario 1: It could happen that a transaction was flagged as in "Under Review" but before an action was taken it "Completed". Simulate such transactions using the keyword "stopatunderreview" in the COMMENT field. 
Scenario 2: It could also happen that the transaction was "completed" and then later a fraud alert email was received and hence was flagged as in "Under Review". Simulate such transactions using the keyword "latefraudalert" in the COMMENT field. 
There is a service which runs every minute that will update the transaction status to Under Review in the first execution. The next time the service runs, it will Complete the transaction. 
These fraud alerts only apply to certain accounts*
:::

:::info
Transaction between users (UserTransfer) is only available for EFT and Visa Direct.
:::

:::info
When a transaction is created with a scheduled start date (delay transaction initiation), it won't be dispatched right away. This transaction will be prepared to be sent to the financial institution according to its scheduled start date.

* Not available for all credit card customers

:::note
You can simulate late failures (Failure after transaction completion) by using a comment: (event name), Latefailure. This feature is only avalible for EFT transaction error. If the string is incorrect, the transaction will fail with the event specified within it.

## Creating a new transaction - Interac peer-to-peer

:::info
This endpoint is not available for all Zūm Rails customers, if you need to use it, make sure to talk with our team.
:::

If you have an environment with Zūm Rails that support Interac peer-to-peer, you will be authorized to create transactions Accounts Receivables (pull) and Accounts Payable (push) only.

The main difference in Interac peer-to-peer is the fact that you have to inform two different users. **UserId** (from) and **TargetUserId** (to), the payload will be like:

`Method: POST`

`Endpoint: {{env}}/api/transaction`

        "InteracHasSecurityQuestionAndAnswer": true,
        "InteracSecurityQuestion": "Your question",
        "InteracSecurityAnswer": "Your answer"

        // If using Account Routing number
        "UseInteracANR": true

        // Specific field required for peer-to-peer accounts payable
        "SessionFingerprint":"JASDFKLJ8324HK...AIJPASDFN23478",
        "SessionIpAddress": "127.0.0.1"
    }
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In case you are doing an Accounts Payable - push - transction, it's important that you call the endpoint [Interac - Send Funds options](../api-specification/users#interac---send-funds-options) to determine the options available for the target user. This endpoint will return if the user needs security question or not, as well tell if the user is eligible for Account Routing Number - [ANR deposits](https://help.zumrails.com/en/articles/5978993-interac-anr).

The definition of all input parameters for this endpoint can be found [here](../api-specification/transactions#creating-a-new-transaction). The definition for all output parameters returned in this endpoint, can be found [here](../api-specification/transactions#get-a-specific-transaction).

:::info
If your Zūm Rails account is configured to user Interac peer-to-peer, you will only be authorized to do Interac transactions. If you need to use other rails, a new Zūm Rails environment will be needed.
:::

:::info
When using Interac peer-to-peer, the email the TargetUserId will receive from Interac will be coming from UserId and not from your Zūm Rails environment. For example, when you do Accounts Payable from a user John, to another user Mary, the email will say: `John is sending funds to Mary`. This setup provides a lot of flexibility. 

Without peer-to-peer, the email would say: `<Your company name> is sending funds to Mary`.

## Status and events

Zūm Rails offers 6 main statuses for transactions:

**Transaction Status**

Type | Description
--------- | -------
InProgress | Indicates the transaction is being processed
Completed | Indicates the transaction is completed, this is a permanent status for Interac, Visa Direct and Credit Card. For EFT, a completed transaction might still fail up to 90 days after it's completion.
Failed | Indicates the transaction has failed, this is a permanent status.
Cancelled | Indicates the transaction has canceled, this is a permanent status.
Scheduled | Indicates the transaction is scheduled.
UnderReview | Indicates the transaction is under review. As of now, only Interac transactions uses this status. Once a transaction is "Under Review" you need to "Take Action" on the transaction from within the portal to guide Interac on how you want to treat this transaction. It could also happen that "Completed" transactions are flagged as "Under Review". This is when Interac requires a response from the Merchant stating if the transactions is legit/fraud/scam Click here to read more. A transaction might be under review up to 7 days, after that our system will automatically cancel it. 

**Transaction Events**

Zūm Rails also offers a more detailed transaction event, to indicate every step the transaction passed. Depending on the transaction methods, the events will change.
