# Transactions

At Zūm Rails, there are 5 ways to create transactions, when using the portal or via API. When creating a transaction via API, the transaction type “ZumRailsType” must be specified.

There are five transaction types (ZumRailsType):

- FundZumWallet
- WithdrawZumWallet
- AccountsPayable
- AccountsReceivable
- UserTransfer

:::note
- Zūm Rails allows money to be sent to a user from your virtual wallet or from your funding source.
- Zūm Rails allows money to be collected from a user to your virtual wallet or to your funding source.
:::

1. If you want to send money from your **Funding Source** to **Zūm Wallet**, use ZumRailsType **FundZumWallet** and inform:
    - FundingSourceId
    - WalletId
2. If you want to withdraw money from **Zūm Wallet** to your **Funding Source**, use ZumRailsType **WithdrawZumWallet** and inform:
    - FundingSourceId
    - WalletId
3. If you want to send money (accounts payable) from your **Zūm Wallet** to a **User**, use ZumRailsType **AccountsPayable** and inform:
    - UserId
    - WalletId
4. If you want to send money (accounts payable) from your **Funding Source** to a **User**, use ZumRailsType **AccountsPayable** and inform:
    - UserId
    - FundingSourceId
5. If you want to withdraw money (accounts receivable) from a **User** to your **Zūm Wallet**, use ZumRailsType **AccountsReceivable** and inform:
    - UserId
    - WalletId
6. If you want to withdraw money (accounts receivable) from a **User** to your **Funding Source**, use ZumRailsType **AccountsReceivable** and inform:
    - UserId
    - FundingSourceId
7. If you want to move money between your **Users**, use ZumRailsType **UserTransfer** and inform:
    - UserId
    - TargetUserId


:::info
- For accounts payable use-case, Zūm Rails recommend you to first Fund the Zūm Wallet, so that the money can be quickly moved.
:::

:::info
- For accounts receivable use-case Zūm Rails, recommend you to move funds from the User to the Zūm Wallet, then set up an automatic daily withdrawal at the end of each day to your funding source.
:::

:::info
- Credit Card transactions are settled directly into the merchant account. Hence, it is not required to specify the `WalletId` or `FundingSourceId` while creating a credit card transaction

:::danger
In a sandbox environment, real bank operations are not performed. However, there is a way to simulate success, failures and review situations.
:::

:::caution
To simulate a failure, use one of the keywords in the field COMMENT while creating a transaction. If no keyword is informed, or something else, the transaction will be considered as a success.
This service is executed every 10 minutes.
:::

:::caution
To simulate a review situation (only available for interac for now), create a transaction with the keyword "InReview" in the field COMMENT.
There is a service which runs every minute that will update the transaction status to InReview in the first execution. The next time the service runs, it will Complete the transaction.
:::

:::info
Transaction between users (UserTransfer) is only available for EFT and Visa Direct.
:::

:::info
When a transaction is created with a scheduled start date, it won't be dispatched right away. This transaction will be prepared to be sent to the financial institution according to its scheduled start date.

Zūm Rails offers 6 main states for transactions:

**Transaction Status**

Type | Description

InProgress | Indicates the transaction is being processed
Completed | Indicates the transaction is completed, this is a permanent status for Interac, Visa Direct and Credit Card. For EFT, a completed transaction might still fail up to 90 days after it's completion.
Failed | Indicates the transaction has failed, this is a permanent status.
Cancelled | Indicates the transaction has canceled, this is a permanent status.
Scheduled | Indicates the transaction is scheduled.
InReview | Indicates the transaction is under review. As of now, only Interac transactions uses this status. A transaction might be under review up to 7 days, after that our system will automatically cancel it.

**Transaction Events**

Zūm Rails also offers a more detailed transaction event, to indicate every step the transaction passed. Depending on the transaction methods, the events will change.
