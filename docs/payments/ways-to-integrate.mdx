  Ways to integrate

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

There are various ways to integrate with Zūm Rails. Check the options below to decide what fits your workflow:

**Full api integration**: You can start using our API endpoints (check API documentation [here](../api-specification/api-introduction)) to create transactions, add users, create invoices, etc.
 With the API integration you have full control over the UI that your end user will see and you can develop it based on your business use cases. 
 This is one of the most secure ways of integrating since all API requests are using the Bearer Token Authorization. 
 A Bearer Token will last up to an hour from the time it is generated, allowing multiple API calls to be made securely without authorizing each time. 
 Understand more about the Authorize endpoint [here](../api-specification/authentication). 

**Portal**: You can use the portal to create transactions, add users, create invoices, etc. 
You can view our FAQs and also check out our video tutorials to learn more about how to start moving money using the portal. 
If you prefer to use the portal, you will not have to do any API integration and you can start right away through the portal.

**Hybrid (recommended)**: We recommend using a mix of both APIs and the portal as it is more robust and secure to use the APIs and you can view the details of your transactions, keep track of the money being moved, download reports, etc. by leveraging 
the functionalities available in the Zūm portal. You can use the API/SDK or host our URL within your application to add users, create transactions, send payment links to your users, etc and receive real time updates on the status of users and transactions so you can automate your next call to action depending on the status of the payments. 


# Zūm Connect

## URL V/S SDK

Our URLs allow you to host our UI within your application and it's the easiest to use for our clients.  
It's a unique URL which you can host as an iframe, send by e-mail or sms. Since, this is a public URL which is not tokenized, it’s not the most recommended option. 

The javascript sdk library allows you to build a more robust integration with Zūm Rails.
Instead of hosting a public URL, the library offers the possibility for you to first create a temporary token, then initiate and receive real-time updates and listen to events.
Hence, it is the best option for our clients. 

To start using the library you will need to do the following:

![URL add user flow](/img/docs/diagrams/flows/flow1.png)

1. **Authorize** using the endpoint `{{env}}/api/authorize`. More information on how to authorize can be found [here](../api-specification/authentication).
2. **Create a token** which has to be informed in the SDK. Use the endpoint `{{env}}/api/connect/createtoken` to generate the token. The token is valid for **15 minutes**, and it will be automatically expired after a user uses it.

    You can also define configurations that will change the behavior of the forms for the requested process. For that you can used the parameters defined [here](./ways-to-integrate#pre-filling-the-form).
    :::


3. Refer the javascript sdk library into your website, build your configuration options and init the sdk. Inform the token (result.Token) in any request you want to execute.

  :::note
  To get the URL/SDK navigate to the settings menu option > Integration codes
  :::

## Install JS SDK 

Refer the js library bellow into your website.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="tab1"
  values={[
    {label: 'Insert on your website', value: 'tab1'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="tab1">

  ```html
    <script id="zumrailssdk" src="https://cdn.zumrails.com/production/zumsdk.js" type="text/javascript" async=""></script>
  ```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>


## Init the JS SDK

**The library expects 1 mandatory parameters:**

Parameter | Description 
----- | ----
token | The token received in the endpoint `{{env}}/api/connect/createtoken`

Bellow you can find an example of the code needed to init the JS SDK.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="tab1"
  values={[
    {label: 'JS SDK Code', value: 'tab1'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="tab1">

  ```html
    <script>
        $(function() {
            $('#btnGoConnect').click(function() {
                const token = '<THE TOKEN RECEIVED IN THE CREATE TOKEN ENDPOINT>';

                ZumRailsSDK.init({
                    token: token,
                    onLoad: function () {
                        console.log('onLoad');
                    },
                    onError: function (error) {
                        console.log('onError', error);
                    },
                    onSuccess: function (data) {
                        console.log('onSuccess', data);
                    },
                    onClosed: function () {
                        console.log('onClosed');
                    },
                });
            });
        });
    </script>
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## SDK callbacks

When something happens, the sdk library will fire a few callbacks, this allows you to easily get the data and take an immediate action. For example, call the endpoint to get the full card information onSuccess by passing the requestId or cardId

### onLoad

This callback is triggered when the UI is loaded and presented on the screen.

_Parameters_

- There are no parameters in this callback


### onClosed

This callback is triggered when the end user clicks in the X button to close the Connect

_Parameters_

- There are no parameters in this callback

### onError

This callback is triggered when the connection failed by any error not expected in the happy flow

_Parameters_

- error: An error message explaining the reason why the failure happened

### onSuccess

This callback is triggered when the connection is completed

_Parameters_

- data: The information returned will depend on the `ConnectTokenType` defined. 

For example, when you use `AddPaymentProfile` will return something like this below:

```json
{
	invoiceId: null,
	userId: '2abc0bda-98bf-40e0-993b-4b76302c0843',
	transactionId: null,
	subscriptionId: null,
	origin: 'ZUM_RAILS'
}
```

## User tokenization / Add payment profile
The best way to add a user to the Zūm Rails platform is through Zūm Connect. It consists of an iFrame website, hosted by Zūm Rails and referenced in your website.

The Zūm Connect iframe will display a form to capture the user's basic information (Full Name and Email) so that we can create an identity.
 
Independent of the method, the user will always be asked to agree and consent the information shared (PAD). The message can be customized for your needs as well.
Your specific settings will be available under your profile in Zūm Rails portal. Depending on your need, you can capture the new user using our webhook mechanism, or if you need it right at the moment we redirect back to your flow, you can capture the Zūm user id (token) by listening to an event message as described in your portal settings.


After a user creates and links his account, you will be able to view it in the Zūm Rails portal or use the API to filter and get a specific user.

### Add payment profile using URL

![URL add user flow](/img/docs/diagrams/flows/flow15.png)


### Pre-filling the form
To help streamline the Zūm Connect experience, it is possible to pass information that you already have through optional parameters in the url:

`{{env}}/connect-adduser/{{customerId}}/{{requestFundsId}}?accountType=personal&memo=memo&comment=here%20is%20an%20example%20comment`

`{{env}}/connect-adduser/{{customerId}}?allowEft=true&language=fr`

`{{env}}/connect-adduser/{{customerId}}?allowEft=true&allowInterac=true`

### Event Listeners

When a new user is added or a request funds is fulfilled, Zūm Connect will trigger an event to provide to your application the UserId, TransactionId or RecurrentTransactionId.

To listen to the event in js, your website must refer to Zūm Connect using an iFrame, and then your website should have the script/example.

          console.log(data);
      }
  });
  </script>

## Invoice checkout
The best way to let the user choose and pay for an item is using the checkout. It consists of an iFrame website, hosted by Zūm Rails and referenced in your website.
The Iframe will display the products/prices to the user and they can choose what they would like to pay for. It will display the form to collect the user’s payment information, then create a transaction and send the invoice to the user over their email once the transaction is successful.

### Invoice checkout using URL

## Subscription checkout
The best way to let the user choose and subscribe to an item is using the checkout. It consists of an iFrame website, hosted by Zūm Rails and referenced in your website.
The Iframe will display the products/prices to the user and they can choose what they would like to subscribe to. It will display the form to collect the user’s payment information, create the subscription and email the subscription details to the user.

:::note
In case of subscription, a new invoice will be generated based on the billing cycle. Whenever a new invoice is generated we will automatically charge the payment method that was used when creating the subscription using the checkout link.

  defaultValue="tab1"
  values={[
    {label: 'Manage user portal', value: 'tab1'}
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="tab1">

  ```json
  {
      "ConnectTokenType": "ManageUserPortal",
      "Email": "customer@zumrails.com"
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
Each user will receive a link along with the emails for invoices/subscription which they can use to manage their account. If they initiate this flow on their own they will be asked to enter their email address > Zum will check if that email address has any subscriptions/invoices under your customer account > if yes, we will send a one-time passcode to the users’ email which if matches with what the user enters in the UI, we will show them their Invoices/subscriptions/payment details.
