## Installation

```script
yarn
```

Note. On Linux you may have to install `autoconf` package to have a successful
installation. On Ubuntu it should be enough to run
`sudo apt-get install autoconf` command to install the package.

## Local development

```script
yarn install
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build for production

```script
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be
served using any static contents hosting service. For that purpose, you can also
use:

```script
yarn serve
```
